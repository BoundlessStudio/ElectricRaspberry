# ElectricRaspberry Testing Plan

## Testing Focus 
Our testing strategy will focus on the following components:

### Services (Priority 1)
Services contain the core business logic and are the most important to test thoroughly.

- [x] StaminaService
  - [x] Initial state tests
  - [x] Stamina consumption and recovery
  - [x] Sleep/wake transitions
  - [x] Forced sleep and wake functions
  - [x] Stamina reset
  
- [x] VoiceService
  - [x] Connection status tests
  - [x] Channel join/leave logic
  - [x] User presence tracking
  - [x] Voice stamina consumption
  - [x] Voice events handling
  
- [x] EmotionalService
  - [x] Emotional state initialization
  - [x] Emotion triggers and responses
  - [x] Emotional expressions
  - [x] Emotional state transitions
  
- [x] ConversationService
  - [x] Message handling
  - [x] Context management
  - [x] Conversation state tracking
  
- [ ] KnowledgeService
  - [ ] Graph operations
  - [ ] Relationship tracking
  - [ ] Memory persistence
  
- [ ] CatchupService
  - [ ] Queue processing
  - [ ] Message prioritization
  
### Handlers (Priority 2)
Handlers connect external events to our service layer and need testing to ensure proper integration.

- [ ] DiscordEventHandlers
  - [ ] Message event handling
  - [ ] User event handling
  - [ ] Channel event handling
  
- [x] VoiceStateHandler
  - [x] Voice state change handling
  - [x] Service integration
  
### Other Components (Lower Priority)
These components are mostly boilerplate or act as direct pass-throughs and do not require extensive testing:

- Configuration classes - Simple data containers
- Model classes - Data structures without complex logic
- Controllers - Thin pass-through to services
- Program.cs - Startup configuration

## Testing Approach

1. Unit Tests
   - Focus on testing services in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test both happy paths and edge cases

2. Testing Pattern
   - Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Name tests using `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern
   - Group tests by service method where appropriate

3. Test Coverage Goals
   - High coverage for service layer (>80%)
   - Medium coverage for handlers (>60%)
   - Low/no coverage for boilerplate code

## Tools Used
- xUnit for test framework
- Moq for mocking dependencies
- FluentAssertions for readable assertions (to be added)
